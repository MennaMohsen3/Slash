This code essentially loads each image from the dataset directory, displays it, makes predictions using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and prints the predicted class for each image. 

*why CNN?*
CNNs are widely used in image processing applications because they can automatically learn hierarchical representations of feature levelsÂ from raw pixel data, making them effective tools for image classification, object recognition, and imagine segmentation.
